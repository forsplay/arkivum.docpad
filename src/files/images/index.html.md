### How It Works
Arkivum’s storage is based on the principle that 3 copies are needed for absolute certainty that data is safe.  So using active integrity checking at all times, every one of your files is copied three times, with 2 copies held online in geographically separated data centres and the third held offline locked away in an escrow service.

Reading and writing data is easy - a gateway appliance sits on you network and delivers your archive as a simple file system - files are simply copied to and from the file system.  Behind the scenes Arkivum’s systems take care of all the replication and integrity checking.  It’s like infinitely expandable, 100% guaranteed network storage.

Naturally, your data is kept secure using industry-standard 256bit AES encryption, to which only you have the keys.

### Seamless Integration with other systems

Arkivum’s service acts like any other server on your network - it integrates into your environment, understands your permissions, and appears to your end users just like other servers. It also has a rich REST API.
